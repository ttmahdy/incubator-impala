/// Query coordinator: handles execution of fragment instances on remote nodes, given a

/// backends; it is also responsible for implementing all client requests regarding the
/// query, including cancellation. Once a query ends, either by returning EOS, through
/// client cancellation, returning an error, or by finalizing a DML request, the
/// coordinator releases resources.
///
/// The coordinator monitors the execution status of fragment instances and aborts the
/// entire query if an error is reported by any of them.
///
/// Queries that have results have those results fetched by calling GetNext(). Results
/// rows are produced by a fragment instance that always executes on the same machine as
/// the coordinator.
///
/// Thread-safe except where noted.
///
/// A typical sequence of calls for a single query (calls under the same numbered
/// item can happen concurrently):

/// 3. client: GetNext()*/client: Cancel()/backend: UpdateBackendExecStatus()

/// A query is considered to be executing until one of three things occurs:
/// 1. An error is encountered. Backend cancellation is automatically initiated for all
///    backends that haven't yet completed and the overall query status is set to the
///    first (non-cancelled) encountered error status.
/// 2. The query is cancelled via an explicit Cancel() call. The overall query status
///    is set to CANCELLED and cancellation is initiated for all backends still
///    executing (without an error status).
/// 3. The query has returned all rows. The overall query status is OK (and remains
